# CycleBerry

This Flask application seeks to use a the information obtained through a JCDecaux API to create an intuitive interface so users can observe the amount of bikes currently at each Dublin Bike rent-a-bike station. It also involves some machine learning to make predictions on future bike levels and some database management to store weather information and bike information over time. AWS and RDS were both used as part of this project.
